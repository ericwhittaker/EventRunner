# EventRunner

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.1.0.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

## Electron Development

### Development Mode
To run the app in Electron development mode:

```bash
npm run electronstart
```

### Packaging (Local Testing)
To create distributable packages locally (for testing):

```bash
npm run electronmake
```
This creates installers in the `/out/make/` folder.

## üöÄ Release Process

### Development Workflow
1. **Code & Commit**: Make your changes and commit them using VS Code GUI (as usual)
2. **Test**: Ensure everything works with `npm run electronstart`

### Release Workflow
When you're ready to release a new version to users:

#### Method 1: Full Release (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Version bump (creates tag + pushes automatically)
npm version minor    # or 'patch' for bug fixes, 'major' for breaking changes
                     # ‚Üë This automatically pushes commits & tags via postversion script

# 2. Build and publish to GitHub Releases
npm run release
```

#### Method 2: Step by Step
```bash
# 1. Version bump (automatically pushes)
npm version minor

# 2. Build Angular app
npm run build

# 3. Publish to GitHub Releases
npm run electronpublish
```

### What Happens During Release
- **npm version minor**: 
  - Updates package.json version (0.3.1 ‚Üí 0.4.0)
  - Creates git commit with version number
  - Creates git tag (v0.4.0)
  - **Automatically pushes commits and tags to GitHub** (via postversion script)
- **npm run release**:
  - Builds Angular app for production
  - Creates Electron installers (.dmg, .exe, etc.)
  - Uploads installers to GitHub Releases
  - Enables auto-updater for existing users

### Auto-Updater
- Users with existing versions will automatically receive update notifications
- Updates download in background and install on next app restart
- Uses GitHub Releases as the update server

### Version Types
- **patch**: Bug fixes (0.3.1 ‚Üí 0.3.2)
- **minor**: New features (0.3.1 ‚Üí 0.4.0) 
- **major**: Breaking changes (0.3.1 ‚Üí 1.0.0)

### Requirements for Release
- Clean working tree (all changes committed)
- Push access to the GitHub repository
- GitHub token configured for electron-forge publisher

## üîë GitHub Token Management

### Current Setup
The GitHub token is stored in your `~/.zshrc` file:
```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_actual_token_here
```

### Token Types: Classic vs Fine-grained
**Use Classic Tokens** for Electron Forge publishing (recommended):
- **Classic Tokens**: Full repo access, simpler setup, works reliably with electron-forge
- **Fine-grained Tokens**: More secure but complex permissions, may have compatibility issues

### Creating a Classic Token
1. Go to GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal access tokens ‚Üí Tokens (classic)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Set expiration (90 days recommended for security)
4. Select scopes:
   - ‚úÖ `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
   - ‚úÖ `write:packages` (Upload packages to GitHub Package Registry)
5. Copy the token immediately (you won't see it again!)

### Updating the Token (Every 90 Days)
When your token expires, you'll need to:

1. **Generate a new token** (follow steps above)
2. **Update your ~/.zshrc file**:
   ```bash
   # Edit the file
   nano ~/.zshrc
   
   # Find this line and replace with new token:
   export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_new_token_here
   
   # Save and reload
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```
3. **Verify it works**:
   ```bash
   echo $GITHUB_TOKEN
   npm run release  # Test the release process
   ```

### Security Best Practices
- ‚úÖ Set token expiration (90 days max)
- ‚úÖ Use minimal required scopes
- ‚úÖ Never commit tokens to git repositories
- ‚úÖ Store in environment variables only
- ‚ùå Don't share tokens or put them in code

## üìù Quick Reference: npm Lifecycle Scripts

### What are Lifecycle Scripts?
npm automatically runs certain script names at specific times. These are RESERVED names, not custom aliases.

### Common Lifecycle Scripts:
```
preversion  ‚Üí Runs BEFORE npm version
version     ‚Üí Runs DURING npm version  
postversion ‚Üí Runs AFTER npm version (we use this to auto-push)

preinstall  ‚Üí Runs before package install
postinstall ‚Üí Runs after package install

pretest     ‚Üí Runs before npm test
posttest    ‚Üí Runs after npm test

prebuild    ‚Üí Runs before npm run build
postbuild   ‚Üí Runs after npm run build
```

### Our Setup:
```json
"postversion": "git push && git push --tags"
```
This is WHY npm version minor automatically pushes - it's not magic, it's a lifecycle script!

### Remember:
- Custom script names: electronstart, release, dev (you make these up)
- Lifecycle scripts: preversion, postversion, pretest (npm controls these)
- Pattern: pre[command] and post[command]

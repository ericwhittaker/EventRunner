# EventRunner Convex Auth Implementation - Simplified Approach

## Overview
Based on research, Convex Auth currently only supports React applications. Since this is an Angular app, we've implemented a simplified approach that:
1. Uses Convex Auth backend (works fine)
2. Calls Convex Auth HTTP endpoints directly from Angular (no React dependencies)
3. Removes dual auth system - only uses Convex Auth
4. Implements admin-controlled user creation instead of public signup

## Architecture Decision
- **Removed**: React-specific Convex Auth patterns (authActions.ts)
- **Removed**: Mock Auth service and dual auth toggle
- **Simplified**: Direct HTTP calls to Convex Auth endpoints
- **Added**: Admin user creation interface in Users component

## Implementation Status

### Phase 1: Backend Setup ✅ COMPLETE
- [✅] 1.1: Install @convex-dev/auth package
- [✅] 1.2: Configure convex/auth.ts with Password provider  
- [✅] 1.3: Update convex/schema.ts with authTables
- [✅] 1.4: Generate API with `npx convex dev --once`
- [✅] 1.5: Create user queries in convex/users.ts

### Phase 2: Frontend Integration ✅ COMPLETE  
- [✅] 2.1: Update ConvexAuthService with HTTP endpoint calls
- [✅] 2.2: Simplify login component (remove dual auth)
- [✅] 2.3: Update auth guard (Convex Auth only)
- [✅] 2.4: Update header component (Convex Auth only)
- [✅] 2.5: Add admin user creation in Users component

### Phase 3: Admin User Management ✅ COMPLETE
- [✅] 3.1: Create user creation dialog in Users component
- [✅] 3.2: Implement signUp functionality via HTTP endpoints
- [✅] 3.3: Remove all mock auth references

## Key Files Modified
- `convex/auth.ts` - Convex Auth configuration
- `convex/schema.ts` - Added authTables
- `convex/users.ts` - User queries and mutations
- `src/app/services/convex-auth.service.ts` - HTTP endpoint integration
- `src/app/components/auth/login.component.ts` - Simplified to Convex only
- `src/app/guards/auth.guard.ts` - Convex Auth only
- `src/app/components/shared/header/header.ts` - Convex Auth only  
- `src/app/components/users/users.component.ts` - Added user creation

## Files Removed
- `convex/authActions.ts` - Was React-specific, not needed for Angular

## Key Insights
1. Convex Auth is React-only currently (confirmed in their FAQ)
2. HTTP endpoints work fine for Angular integration
3. Admin-controlled user creation is cleaner than public signup
4. Simplified single-auth approach reduces complexity

## Next Steps for Testing
1. Start development server
2. Test user creation via admin interface
3. Test login/logout flow
4. Verify auth guard protection on routes

## Production Considerations
- Consider migrating to Clerk or Auth0 for more features
- Or wait for Convex Auth to add Angular support
- Current approach is functional but not as polished as native support
